well, Random Forest models of dataset 3 had much lower prediction accuracy than models of datasets 1 and 2.
The correlation method operates regardless of feature importance. E.g. in dataset 1, the features with the
highest importance were also flagged as highly correlated. Correlation models performed worst in all three
datasets. RFE and GA tend to include features with high importance, but feature importance alone is not a
good indicator for whether several features will work well in combination when predicting an outcome.
Dataset 1 was small with only 9 features; here, removing highly correlated features was the least successful
selection method. RFE and GA both improved the predictions compared to no feature selection, while GA
performed best. Dataset 2 with its 30 original features produced the best models with the GA. And in dataset 3,
which had lower overall accuracy, different feature selection methods did not have a strong influence.","Random Forest, Recursive Feature Elimination, Genetic Algorithm, Corrlelation",Wisconsin Madison Breast Cancer Datasets,R Programming ,R Studio
